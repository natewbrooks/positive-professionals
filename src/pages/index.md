    management, and government. Diversity, Equity & Belonging (DEB) is our
    forte, and we're passionate about individual and team coaching.


    Each coach has tackled the challenges of building multidisciplinary teams,
    negotiated alliances, developed motivating visions, led large organizations,
    turned around poor performers, and driven change to achieve unprecedented
    mission successes. But our story is about more than professional
    achievements. Our proudest accomplishments and greatest joys center around
    our families.

        about the client – their agenda, their choices, their transformation.

        effective decision-making. She then partners with her clients as they
        work to bring greater resiliency and creativity into their lives in a

      quote: >-
        Engaging in the PQ program and training has been a transformative
        journey for me, significantly enhancing my emotional intelligence.
        Through consistent practice, I've learned to observe my thoughts and
        emotions without judgment, allowing me to develop a deeper understanding
        of my own inner workings.


        PQ training has granted me the ability to stay present in the moment,
        fostering better self-awareness and emotional regulation. This newfound
        awareness enables me to respond to situations more thoughtfully, rather
        than reacting impulsively based on my emotions. I've noticed a positive
        shift in my interpersonal relationships, as I now approach interactions
        with greater empathy and understanding.


        In moments of stress or challenge, techniques learned from PQ training
        serve as an anchor, helping me maintain composure and make informed
        decisions. It has become an invaluable tool in navigating the
        complexities of daily life, contributing not only to my personal
        well-being but also to the quality of my connections with others. I am
        grateful for the positive impact it has had on my life.
